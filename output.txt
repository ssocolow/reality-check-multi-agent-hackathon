Coronavirus symptoms include fever, a dry cough and breathing problems.

COVID-19 infects the lungs as it is a respiratory disease and it can take five days on average to start showing symptoms.

However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incubation period can last up to 14 days.

The early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu.

In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said moral judgment must be made in temporarily sacrificing individual rights while working for the “greater good” to save potentially many thousands of lives.

Advice to the public includes avoiding all non-essential contact, a measure which is particularly important for the over-70s and others who are most vulnerable to succumb to the infection.

The coronavirus has so far infected close to 1.4 million people worldwide and killed more than 79,000.

Since the virus was discovered, scientists have attempted to find a cure.

Coronavirus cure: COVID-19 cannot be cured by drinking water (Image: GETTY)

## Does drinking warm water help cure coronavirus?

False claims about how you can protect yourself from COVID-19 have been spreading online.

In March, Malaysian Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba's adviced Malaysians to drink warm water to "flush" the virus down to the stomach.

According to the health minister, the digestive acids found in the stomach would kill any virus.

Health Minister appeared on RTM's Bicara Naratif programme and claimed the virus cannot take heat, and the warm water would also flush virus into the stomach.

He said: ”Do not drink water that is not boiled. Drink a glass of water that is warm because the virus does not like warm things. Make sure (the water) is not too hot.

"The virus will go down (the oesophagus) and when it reaches the stomach which has acids, the virus dies. That's how we eliminate the virus.

"What's important is that we have to kill the virus in our throats before it reaches our lungs.

"This virus, it likes the lower part of the lungs. It likes to stay there. That's why it is said that this virus loves human beings.”

However, the claims quickly came under question and Kalpana Sabapathy, a clinical epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told BBC Future drinking water doesn’t kill coronavirus.

Ms Sabapathy explained infections often begin after we’ve been exposed to thousands or millions of viral particles, so sweeping a few down the oesophagus is unlikely to have much of an impact.

She said: “One gaping hole in it is the likelihood that you managed to flush all of them down into your stomach.

“You would probably have already got them in your nostrils by then, for example – it’s not fool proof.”
